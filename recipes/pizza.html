        <ol>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large pizza pan.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll bread dough out into a large circle about 18-inches in diameter; transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Build up the edges, and prick the center all over with a fork so it doesn't form a dome when baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the salad dressing over hot crust. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the Swiss cheese. Arrange corned beef on top of cheese, then drizzle with remaining salad dressing. Top with sauerkraut and remaining Swiss cheese. Sprinkle with caraway seed.</li>
            <li>Bake for another 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese melts and toppings are heated through. Sprinkle with chopped pickle. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
